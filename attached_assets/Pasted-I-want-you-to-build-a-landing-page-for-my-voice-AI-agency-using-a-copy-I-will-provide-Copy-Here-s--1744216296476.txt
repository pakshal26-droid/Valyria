### The Old Way (Pain Points)  
Subheader:  
"Why Human-Centric Lead Follow-Up Fails for High-Volume Businesses"  
Body:  
- ❌ Agents call leads once, then give up – 80% of conversions happen after 5+ follow-ups (your team does 1.2 on average).  
- ❌ Inconsistent timing – Calling at 3 PM when the lead is free at 8 PM.  
- ❌ Poor lead prioritization – Agents can’t detect urgency in a prospect’s voice or questions.  
- ❌ Rookie mistakes – Low-paid agents sound robotic, killing trust in your ₹10Cr+ brand.

### The New Way (AI-Driven Lead Conversion)  
Subheader:  
"How Top 1% Brands Qualify Leads While You Sleep"  
Body:  
- ✅ AI learns your lead’s habits: Calls at 8 PM if they opened emails at 8 PM last week.  
- ✅ Unlimited follow-ups: 100% of leads get 8+ contact attempts across call/WhatsApp/SMS.  
- ✅ Voice analytics: Detects urgency (“Need this by Diwali!”) and routes hot leads to your closers.  
- ✅ Your brand voice, automated: Trained on your best sales calls to mimic top performers.
